  This is my idea, aiming to connect young people who are fond of music and would like to share with friends.
Personally, I have many experience about sharing music with my boyfriend and friends. Sometimes we not only 
can find new music during the interaction , but also feel really enjoyable, liking they are accompanying
with you wherever and whenever.
  Therefore, I ended up with the system that music can be transferred from your friends' phones to your phone
and be played automatically through the device little plant light. It is entertaining that your friends choose 
some pop music for cheering you up when you are cooking by yourself. You also can remind your friends by sending 
several light music. It could be more emotional that people express their care and thinking by this way.
  Signals such as connecting, receiving music, playing other's music will be presented by the different color 
and change of mode of the little plant light.
