  Switch statement

 Demonstrates the use of a switch statement.  The switch
 statement allows you to choose from among a set of discrete values
 of a variable.  It's like a series of if statements.

 To see this sketch in action, but the board and sensor in a well-lit
 room, open the serial monitor, and and move your hand gradually
 down over the sensor.

 The circuit:
 * photoresistor from analog in 0 to +5V
 * 10K resistor from analog in 0 to ground

// these constants won't change. They are the

int ledPinRed = 13;      // select the pin for the LED
int ledPinGreen = 12;      // select the pin for the LED



void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication:
  Serial.begin(9600);

  pinMode(ledPinRed, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ledPinGreen, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // read the sensor:
  int sensorReading = analogRead(A0);
  Serial.println(sensorReading);
  // map the sensor range to a range of four options:

     if (sensorReading < 300)
     {
     // Serial.println("red");
       digitalWrite(ledPinRed, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ledPinGreen, LOW);
     }
